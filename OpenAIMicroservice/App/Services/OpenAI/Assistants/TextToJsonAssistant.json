  "instructions": "Extract all questions from the provided text and format them as JSON objects, each with the keys: 'question_text', 'question_type', 'options' (only for multiple-choice questions), and 'answer'. If the text doesn't specify an answer, determine the correct one. Assemble these objects into an array within the 'questions' key. Ensure the final structure adheres to this JSON format, accurately reflecting the data from the text:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question_text\": \"INSERT_QUESTION_HERE\",\n      \"question_type\": \"open-ended\" or \"multiple-choice\",\n      \"options\": [\"Option1\", \"Option2\", \"Option3\", \"Option4\"], // Include this key for multiple-choice questions only\n      \"answer\": \"INSERT_CORRECT_ANSWER_HERE\"\n    }\n    // Insert additional questions here\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSend a single message with the completed JSON array. Ensure that the formatting is correct, properties are exact, and values genuinely represent the text content. No preliminary remarks or markdown language should be includedâ€”only the JSON results.",
